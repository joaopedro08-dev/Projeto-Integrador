The **Integrative Project** was developed in 2025 by 3rd-year students of **SESI Ourinhos** (SP), in partnership with **SENAI**.
🎯 The main objective was to build an **educational website** applying the technical knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (optional), learned in the SENAI classes.

Additionally, the project involved **pedagogical research** in 8 school subjects, fostering the integration of technical and academic content.
